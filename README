PNGback
=======

PNGback is a Javascript library for parsing PNG files, for node.js

Right now it is of Very Little Use(TM) as I have not yet implemented compression/decompression, but it can read PNG files and do some simple stuff on them, like extract (uncompressed!) metadata.

It will shortly be able to write out files as well as read them.

It is completely event driven.



TODO, in no particular order

1. write out files
2. better tests
3. zlib implementation for compression and decompression
4. smush implementation as example
5. browser version
