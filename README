zlib.js
=======

zlib.js is a pure Javascript library for gzip and related compression methods, RFC 1950, 1951, 1952

Currently being tested for node.js, but should port to browser. Originally developed for my PNGback PNG library

It is completely event driven.


CURRENT STATUS

Only implements the uncompressed handler for both inflate and deflate, so entirely useless.

Other than that, starting to pass the tests!
